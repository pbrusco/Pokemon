# CLAUDE.md — Agent Guide for My Pokemon

## Hints
Node and npm may not be available directly, but I do have access to them:
❯ which node
/opt/homebrew/bin/node
❯ which npm
/opt/homebrew/bin/npm

Maybe use:
export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH" && cd /Users/pbrusco/projects/poke && npm run ...

## Reference

When in doubt about map layouts, building positions, NPC placements, tile types, or any game data:
- **pokered source** — https://github.com/pret/pokered (decompiled Pokémon Red ROM; canonical reference for maps, scripts, constants, sprite data)

## Vision

This is a faithful recreation of Pokémon Red / Fire Red (Gen I) built with modern web tech (React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Zustand). The goal is to reproduce the original gameplay feel — turn-based battles, tile movement, Kanto story — not to clone the visuals pixel-for-pixel. Mechanics (damage formula, type chart, stat calc, status effects) follow Gen I rules. All in-game text is in Spanish. Scope is Gen I: 151 Pokémon, Kanto region, full storyline from Pallet Town through the Indigo Plateau (work-in-progress; extending map by map).

## Architecture

All game state lives in a Zustand store (`src/store/gameStore.ts`) with `zustand/persist` for localStorage save/load. `App.tsx` is a thin shell that wires hooks and renders components. Logic lives in hooks: `useBattleEngine` drives `battleEngine.ts` (pure state machine), `useMovementEngine` handles movement/collision/encounters, `useInteractionEngine` handles NPC/item/tile interactions, `useInputHandler` manages keyboard + movement loop. Hooks read state via `useGameStore.getState()` inside `setTimeout` to avoid stale closures.

`battleStateRef` holds mutable `BattleState` during fights (initialized by `initBattle`, driven by `useBattleEngine`).

## Tileset Rendering

Maps are rendered via a canvas-generated pixel art tileset (`src/data/tileset/tilesetGenerator.ts`). The autotiler (`src/data/tileset/autotiler.ts`) converts the semantic `Tile[][]` grid into three rendering layers:
- **ground** — base terrain (grass, path, floor, roof, walls)
- **objects** — tree trunks, furniture, signs (z-indexed by row, below player/NPCs)
- **overhead** — tree canopies (z-indexed above player for walk-behind depth)

`GameTile` is a `React.memo` component that renders a single `<div>` with `background-position` on the tileset spritesheet. Tile IDs are defined in `tilesetGenerator.ts` as `T.GRASS`, `T.ROOF_M`, etc.

## Phase FSM

```
EXPLORING → MENU | INVENTORY | TEAM | SHOP | POKEDEX | PC | EDITOR
         → BATTLE_TRANSITION → BATTLE(sub)
         → HEALING | BLACKOUT

BATTLE sub-phases:
  CHOOSING → PLAYER_ATTACK → ENEMY_ATTACK → CHOOSING
           → PLAYER_FAINTED → FORCED_SWITCH
           → ENEMY_FAINTED → LEVEL_UP → [EVOLVING] → CHOOSING / EXPLORING
           → CATCHING
  BATTLE_INVENTORY / BATTLE_TEAM → CHOOSING
```

Imports: `EXPLORING`, `MENU`, `INVENTORY`, `TEAM`, `SHOP`, `POKEDEX`, `PC`, `EDITOR`, `battle()`, `B_CHOOSING` → `src/types/gamePhase.ts`

## Common Pitfalls

**Wrong imports:**
- `TILE_SIZE`, `Position`, `Direction`, `NPC`, `Entity`, `Pokemon`, `MapID` → `src/types.ts`
- `BattleAction`, `BattleState`, `stepBattle`, `createBattleState` → `src/lib/battleEngine.ts`
- `BattleAction` is NOT in `src/types/gamePhase.ts`
- Maps have per-file dimensions (no single `GRID_SIZE` constant). Use `grid.length` (height) and `grid[0].length` (width) when iterating a map.

**Side effects in state updaters** (React Strict Mode calls updaters twice):
```typescript
// WRONG
setPlayerTeam(prev => { setTimeout(() => setPhase(EXPLORING), 1000); return newTeam; });
// CORRECT
const newTeam = [...gameState.current.playerTeam];
setPlayerTeam(newTeam);
setTimeout(() => setPhase(EXPLORING), 1000);
```

**NPC placement** — use `buildNPCDatabase()` in `npcDatabase.ts`, not `worldConfig.ts`.

## Invariants

- All in-game text must be in **Spanish**.
- Inventory is `Record<itemId, number>`, not an array.
- On evolution: recompute `baseStats`, `maxHp`, `hp` — don't copy from pre-evolution.
- NPC IDs are globally unique (used in flat `defeatedTrainers` array).
- Sprite IDs = PokeAPI Pokédex numbers (Bulbasaur = 1).
- Coordinates: `(0,0)` top-left, x→right, y→down.
- No backward compatibility — delete old code, no shims.
- If npm is not found on macOS: `export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:$PATH"`
- **Pre-commit script**: Always run `bash .githooks/pre-commit` before finishing a task. This script runs `tsc` (including unused checks), `vitest`, and `knip`.

## Testing

When testing UX, interactions, or game logic, prioritize using the existing **Vitest** implementation over interacting manually via the browser.
- Run tests via `npm run test:run`.
- The game uses `@testing-library/react` to render hooks and test state machines efficiently without the overhead of a headless browser.

### Game Simulator (integration tests)

`src/test/simulator/` contains a headless `GameSimulator` that composes all three game hooks (`useMovementEngine`, `useBattleEngine`, `useInteractionEngine`) via a single `useGameLoop` hook rendered with `renderHook`. It drives the real game logic without UI, using fake timers and seeded `Math.random` for deterministic, instant execution.

**Key files:**
- `src/test/simulator/GameSimulator.ts` — Simulator class: commands (`move`, `interact`, `battleAction`, `tick`, `skipBattleTransition`), state queries (`phase`, `map`, `team`, `dialogue`), event log, random seeding
- `src/test/simulator/useGameLoop.ts` — Composite hook wiring all three engines with stubbed visual callbacks
- `src/test/simulator/scenarios.test.ts` — 10 predefined scenarios from game start through mid-game

**Writing a new scenario:**
```typescript
it('my scenario', () => {
  const sim = new GameSimulator().init({
    currentMap: 'OAKS_LAB',
    playerPos: { x: 9, y: 9 },
    direction: 'up',
    playerTeam: [],
  });
  sim.interact();                    // press action button
  sim.dismissDialogue();             // clear dialogue
  sim.tick(2000);                    // advance fake timers
  sim.skipBattleTransition();        // skip animation-based transition
  expect(sim.phase.type).toBe('BATTLE');
  expect(sim.dialogueContains('AZUL')).toBe(true);
  sim.destroy();
});
```

**Simulator gotchas:**
- **Input handling:** The `GameSimulator` bypasses `useInputHandler.ts` by invoking engine hooks (`sim.interact()`, `sim.move()`) directly. If you modify global input-interception logic (like closing dialogues or locking keys via KeyboardEvents), you **must** also test it manually in the browser or create a DOM test simulating real `KeyboardEvent`s, as `renderHook` integration tests will miss global listener bugs.
- `BATTLE_TRANSITION → BATTLE(CHOOSING)` requires a DOM animation callback. Call `sim.skipBattleTransition()` to advance past it in headless mode.
- `sim.setRandomSequence([0.05, ...])` to control encounter/crit/status RNG.
- `sim.phaseHistory()` returns all phase transitions as strings for easy assertion.

### Unit tests

- `src/hooks/__tests__/useInteractionEngine.test.ts` — Tests NPC/item/tile interactions via Zustand store overrides. Uses `setup()` helper that configures the store and renders the hook.
- `src/lib/__tests__/battleEngine.test.ts` — Pure state-machine tests for the battle engine.
- `src/lib/__tests__/damage.test.ts` — Damage formula, type effectiveness, stat calculations.
- `src/lib/__tests__/statusRules.test.ts` — Gen I status effect rules.
# CLAUDE.md

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.


Have in mind the TODO.md file also.

## graphify

This project has a graphify knowledge graph at graphify-out/.

Rules:
- Before answering architecture or codebase questions, read graphify-out/GRAPH_REPORT.md for god nodes and community structure
- If graphify-out/wiki/index.md exists, navigate it instead of reading raw files
- For cross-module "how does X relate to Y" questions, prefer `graphify query "<question>"`, `graphify path "<A>" "<B>"`, or `graphify explain "<concept>"` over grep — these traverse the graph's EXTRACTED + INFERRED edges instead of scanning files
- After modifying code files in this session, run `graphify update .` to keep the graph current (AST-only, no API cost)
